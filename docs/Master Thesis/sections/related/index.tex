\subsection{Outcome}

In this chapter many different topics were covered. Computer vision basics such as thresholding, filtering, image processing were described. Multiple feature detection algorithms such as \ac{SURF} and \ac{SIFT} were studied. In addition, the overview of the Kalman filter was presented. This material was written to prepare the reader for the next chapter where computer vision experiments are covered.
