I would like to express my gratitude to the supervisor Artjom Lind as well as the head of the "Distributed Systems" research group professor Eero Vainikko who have guided me for this two long years through the complex world of computer vision field of knowledge. This involved me in multiple research projects that were the basis for the current thesis and I am really thankful to them.
